## Introduction 🌟

WinHubX was born from the original idea of **mrnico98**, a talented programmer who created a versatile tool designed to optimize and manage Windows systems. With his vision and expertise, an initial promising solution was developed, laying the foundation for future evolutions.

However, as the project became outdated over time and was only supported in the LTS (Long Term Support) version, the decision was made to initiate an active improvement process. Starting today, the project is officially under the management of the [**OpenDevNetwork**](https://t.me/OpenDevNetwork), a global developer community, with the goal of further strengthening its evolution and making it an even more powerful tool.

With the support and collaboration of **@LightYagami28**, this idea evolved into an open-source project managed by the community. By combining forces and resources, WinHubX becomes an increasingly useful solution for users around the world. Together, we are committed to creating a collaborative environment where contributions are welcome and innovation thrives. 🚀

Soon, the project will transition into a playbook format, providing more structure and resources for contributors to follow and implement.
