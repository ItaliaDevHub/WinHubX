<summary>## Introduction 🌟</summary>

WinHubX was born from the original idea of **mrnico98**, a talented programmer who created a versatile tool designed to optimize and manage Windows systems. With his vision and expertise, an initial promising solution was developed, laying the foundation for future evolutions.

However, as the project became outdated over time and was only supported in the LTS (Long Term Support) version, the decision was made to initiate an active improvement process. Starting today, the project is officially under the management of the [**OpenDevNetwork**](https://t.me/OpenDevNetwork), a global developer community, with the goal of further strengthening its evolution and making it an even more powerful tool.

With the support and collaboration of **@LightYagami28**, this idea evolved into an open-source project managed by the community. By combining forces and resources, WinHubX becomes an increasingly useful solution for users around the world. Together, we are committed to creating a collaborative environment where contributions are welcome and innovation thrives. 🚀

<summary>## Archive – Official Project Closure 📦</summary>

### 📌 Project Archived

After careful consideration, we are officially **archiving the WinHubX project**.

#### Reasons for Closure:

- **Superior Existing Alternatives:**  
  Several mature and active tools already cover the same scope more efficiently:
  - [massgrave.dev](https://massgrave.dev)
  - [Microsoft Activation Scripts](https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts)
  - [Debloat 3.0 (by WindowsItalia/Iblis94)](https://github.com/Iblis94/debloat3.0)

- **Unintentional UI Similarities:**  
  During an internal review, we found that **WinHubX’s UI design closely resembles the one used in Debloat 3.0 by Iblis94**.  
  This design was **originally created by a previous developer**, not by the current OpenDevNetwork team.  
  We were unaware of this overlap and **sincerely apologize to the WindowsItalia team for the unintended similarity**.

#### ⚠️ Unauthorized Forks / Playbooks

As the project is now **archived**, any further use of the **WinHubX** name or the creation of **playbooks or forks derived from this repository** is **not authorized by the present team**.  
Please refrain from using the WinHubX identity in unofficial continuations.

#### 🔎 Security Warning – Previous Builds

We would also like to inform users that an **older version of WinHubX**, still linked to **mrnico98**, is currently listed on VirusTotal with potential concerns:

> [VirusTotal Scan - WinHubX legacy build (mrnico98)](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/24b69695416ca3cebe6f1cc493c1de13ff63ec738798ca3939d9b6fca6e4278a)

We strongly recommend not downloading or using unofficial builds or outdated binaries.

**WinHubX** remains available in **read-only mode** for educational and historical reference.
